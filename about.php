                    <p style="line-height: 2;">Transportation has been an essential part of human endeavors and most importantly a key sector that drives a nation’s economy. In advance nations, it contributed not less than 30 – 40 percent of countries Gross domestic product but in Nigeria and other Africa countries the reverse is the case.
                      What accounted for the setback in Nigeria and neighboring African countries are unethical practices, unprofessionalism and neglect of international best practice by the human element in the sector. The need to correct these and passion for reformation, professionalism and safety of human and resources convey via this sector brings about the establishment of WESTERN COAST TRANSPORT ACADEMY (WECTA).
