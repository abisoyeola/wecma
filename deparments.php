                        <h3>MARINE ENGINEERING</h3>
                    <p>Students studying Marine Engineering learn about the operation and maintenance of propulsion and auxiliary machinery, how to speedily detect all equipment glitches and execute the necessary repairs. They learn about the maintenance of various systems on the vessel such as electrical, pumps and piping systems, hydraulic power systems, fresh water generation, steam propulsion, and compressed air circuits. These will include in-class learning, highly modernized marine simulators, and practical experience on board vessels at sea.

                        <h3>SHIPPING MANAGEMENT</h3>
                    <p>This field of study looks at the purchasing and supply of shipped items, an assignment which requires knowledge of management and shipping procedures. Courses for this diploma will seek to educate you in every aspect of supply chain dynamics. Some of that includes dock structures, supply and demand predictions, and warehouse logistics. There is typically also preparation to take on leadership roles. Depending on the institution, certain training and experience may be required. The analytic skills learned from a shipping management diploma can be used in many different job and life situations.
